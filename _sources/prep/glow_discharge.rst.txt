    Review and Update

Switch on the machine and just click on `AUTO RUN`. The parameters that will be
used are indicated in the screen. If you wish to change them just press `PROJ`
and then change the parameters using the touch screen. Useful
parameters to
change are the current and the time for glow discharge. The vacuum level to be
reached is set to 0.39mBar.
You can decide also to run one of the preset programs.
To run a program press `MAIN` then select `PROTOCOLS` in the touch screen,
then `RUN SCREEN` and `AUTORUN`.
There are 4 glow discharge programs with the following parameters:

* PROGRAM 1. Glow discharge for 40 sec with a current of 20mA
* PROGRAM 2. Glow discharge for 40 sec with a current of 15mA
* PROGRAM 3. Glow discharge for 60 sec with a current of 20mA
* PROGRAM 4. Glow discharge for 60 sec with a current of 21mA

When making graphene oxide you can use PROGRAM 4. When glow
discharging positively using amylamine a shorter time (PROGRAM 1 or 2) is
recommended. Remember to run an empty run
after you used amylamine.
Please do not change program setting without telling me. We can always decide
to change these programs, but then we need to upgrade this sheet
