    Review and Update

.. warning::

    YOU MUST BE TRAINED BY AN EXPERIENCED MEMBER OF THE EM GROUP BEFORE YOU CAN BOOK AND USE THE VITROBOT
    IF YOU ARE NOT SURE HOW TO DO SOMETHING PLEASE ASK FOR ADVICE ALWAYS WEAR PROTECTIVE GLASSES!


Starting
--------

* **Turn on the Vitrobot** using the main power switch located at the rear panel

* **Replace filter paper** (16 blots max)

  * It is convenient to replace it when the central rod is up, for example, when you start the Vitrobot
  * Use gloves and tweezers to avoid contaminating the paper
  * Make sure not to bend the paper in the box when you take it out or close the box
  * Clip with circular clipping rings: the concave side of the paper is put against the blot
    pads(do not apply excessive pressure on the blotting pads)

* **If using the humidifier fill it up with dH20**

  * Pull in the humidifier cable so it doesn't get stuck (don't disconnect)
  * Clip on the humidifier with the bayonette clip-on lock
  * Fill with 60 mL of dH20 with syringe (40 mL if top-up requested by the Vitrobot
    software)
  * Remove air with syringe suction

* **Set up temperature and humidity parameters in the Console window**

  * Note: increasing the humidity will affect the temperature in the chamber, and for
    critical experiment an additional time for thermal equilibration might be required (see the manual for details)

* **Set up parameters in the Options window**

* **Recommended options in Miscellaneous box:**

  * Humidifier off during sample processing
  * Skip grid transfer

* **Specify the following in Process Parameters in Options window**:
  * Blot Total – the number of blottings
  * Blot time - the time for each individual blot
  * Blot force - force of the blotpads applied onto the grid
  * Wait time - time before blotting
  * Drain time - time between blotting and plunge freezing
  * Skip sample application: if sample already on grid (e.g. Cells)

* `Save` the program (you can also `Load` previously saved program from a list)
* You can also `Add` or a `Delete` step(s) for sequential blotting and determine parameters
* **Test the program before you start working**
* Leave the Vitrobot to equilibrate for 20-30 min


Material Preparation
--------------------
• Glow discharge grids (more than required)
• Prepare hairdryer
• Prepare 5 L LN2 dewar, small dewar with Falcon tubes, small thermos flask for topping up the coolant chamber with filtered LN2
• Prepare Falcon tubes, grid boxes and screwdrivers or rods


Prepare the coolant container
• Insert brass coloured inner cup, grid box holder, the spindle/spider and anti-
contamination ring
• Fill up the inner and outer chamber with LN2 and let it settle
• Wait until LN2 evaporates from the brass coloured cup, top up the outer cup if
necessary
Condense ethane when the cooling chamber is ready
• Inner brass cup needs to be EMPTY, ALWAYS WORK IN THE FUME HOOD,
WEAR GLASSES AND GLOVES
• Open the three valves of the ethane cylinder
• Red and right black first (both counter clockwise to open), then left black
(clockwise to open) - the flow of this valve should be low at first, then around 1
• Better too slow than too fast
• Put the fume hood screen down
• Position the pipette tip at the bottom of the brass coloured cup
• Fill up to the top
• Wait for white ethane crust to form around the edges of the cup
• Then remove the cooling spindle/spider – if frozen use flat end of the large
tweezers or a spare brass coloured cup to thaw the top quickly
• Top up the LN2 as required
• Place the grid box(es) onto the grid box holder (TEST them!)
• Transfer the coolant chamber and LN2 thermos flask next to the Vitrobot


Vitrobot Cycle
--------------
Press Place new grid
• Pick up a glow–discharged grid with the Vitrobot tweezers
• Make sure that the black clamping ring of the tweezers is fixed at the first notch
(counting from top of the tweezers – not from the grid!) and that the grid doesn’t fall
off in vertical position
• Mount the tweezers (spring forward - unless blotting was optimised with the wrong
RHS position)
• Check if the grid is centred on the rod
Press Start process and the tweezers will be taken into the climate chamber
• If Autoraise Ethanelift is on, the cooling chamber will automatically be lifted; if not
click next button
• If something goes wrong, just press Place new grid
Press Continue
• If Skip application is on, blotting will start
• If not, tweezers will be lowered down to apply the sample (typically 3 uL)
Press Continue to move on to blotting and plunge
As the coolant chamber is lowering down, top it up with LN2 to the level above the grid
boxes
Carefully disconnect the tweezers from the central axis, lift the coolant container from the
support ring and position it next to Vitrobot
Transfer the grid into LN2 and then into the grid box
Remove tweezers, dry them and pickup a new grid
• Press Place new grid to freeze another sample


Shutting down
-------------
TAKE THE TWEEZERS OFF
Press EXIT and confirm that the tweezers were removed
Switch off
EMPTY HUMIDIFIER
• Pour water out
• Remove remaining water from the bottom with the syringe
•

ADDITONALLY
• At 99% humidity the sample does not concentrate by evaporation
• Note that blotting parameters (time and number of blottings) determine the initial
thickness of the thin film, further thinning will occur during the drain time
• If temperature is important, keep samples in a water bath prior to loading
• For low viscosity of samples sequential quick blottings are recommended; for high
viscosity sample - longer blotting time
• Consider using low temperature (4 C) and no humidifier: after 30 min there will be
~90% humidity in the chamber without any steam or condensation
